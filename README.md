# File-Sharing-System

This program is constructed on the client-server paradigm.
A client logs onto the server to request information about a file. The server indicates to the client which other entity has the file and a peer-to-peer connection is established for the 2 clients to share the file.
A client can post to the server aswell information about what files it has and accept requests for transfer from other clients.
